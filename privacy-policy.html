			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>Here at marcoafonso.pt, I, Marco Afonso, take your privacy seriously and will only use your personal data for analytics and statistics using Google Analytics in order to deliver the best content to you.</p>
			<h2>What data is collected?</h2>
			<p>I collect data to know how my users use the website and optimize it for your needs. However, I do not collect personal data like your name, gender, age, etc. You will remain anonymous throughout the process, as I cannot identify you nor know who or where you are exactly. I cannot track you between sessions of browsing, it's like you are a different person in each session you do. Therefore, I will only collect:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Part of your IP to know what country you are from. I won't know your exact location like the city you are in.
				</li>
				<li>
					Information about the browser you are using, window size, operating system and device type (mobile, desktop or tablet).
				</li>
				<li>
					The time you accessed the site and how much time you spend there.
				</li>
				<li>
					In one session of browsing, know if you went back to the website.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>What do I do with your data?</h2>
			<p>The data is kept no longer than a period of 26 months. This allows me to see and analyse the website's evolution in the long run. This data allows me to better understand how to design and write the website for the kind people that visit my site the most. All of my activity falls within the bounds of the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a>.</p>
			<h3>Want to opt-out?</h3>
			<p>You can opt-out Google Analytics altogether and disable their tracking using a <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">browser plugin</a>.</p>
